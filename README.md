# Ryan-Cuthbert-Blog

## Description

This is a blog application which dynamically renders blog posts from local storage onto the screen. Users can post as many times as they wish. Users have the option to customize the layout according to their preferences with a light/dark theme toggle button. Make sure to fill in each input field as the app will prompt the user if any of the input fields are empty.

## Note
I used xpert learning assistant to debug some errors, as well as a guide in some areas, in specific, to avoid local storage from resetting each time a user submits information into the form. Just to clarify, I used this as a guide to point myself in the right direction, but the code in this project was written completely by myself.
